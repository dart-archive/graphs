/// Returns a topological sort of the nodes of the directed edges of a graph

/// nodes that have edges leading to that node. The result is not guaranteed to
/// be unique, nor is it guaranteed to be stable across releases of this
/// package; however, it will be stable for a given input within a given package
/// version.
///
/// If [equals] is provided, it is used to compare nodes in the graph. If
/// [equals] is omitted, the node's own [Object.==] is used instead.
///
/// Similarly, if [hashCode] is provided, it is used to produce a hash value
/// for nodes to efficiently calculate the return value. If it is omitted, the
/// key's own [Object.hashCode] is used.
///
/// If you supply one of [equals] or [hashCode], you should generally also to
/// supply the other.
///
/// If you supply [secondarySort], the resulting list will be sorted by that
/// comparison function as much as possible without violating the topological
/// ordering. Note that even with a secondary sort, the result is _still_ not
/// guaranteed to be unique or stable across releases of this package.
///
/// Note: this requires that [nodes] and each iterable returned by [edges]
/// contain no duplicate entries.
