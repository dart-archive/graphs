/// Finds the strongly connected components of a directed graph using Tarjan's
/// algorithm.
///
/// The result will be a valid reverse topological order ordering of the
/// strongly connected components. Components further from a root will appear in
/// the result before the components which they are connected to.
///
/// Nodes within a strongly connected component have no ordering guarantees,
/// except that if the first value in [nodes] is a valid root, and is contained
/// in a cycle, it will be the last element of that cycle.
///
/// [nodes] must contain at least a root of every tree in the graph if there are
/// disjoint subgraphs but it may contain all nodes in the graph if the roots
/// are not known.
///
/// If [equals] is provided, it is used to compare nodes in the graph. If
/// [equals] is omitted, the node's own [Object.==] is used instead.
///
/// Similarly, if [hashCode] is provided, it is used to produce a hash value
/// for nodes to efficiently calculate the return value. If it is omitted, the
/// key's own [Object.hashCode] is used.
///
/// If you supply one of [equals] or [hashCode], you should generally also to
/// supply the other.
